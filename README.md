# ðŸŽ“ Final Project for 3190 Final Project

This was the final project for the _Introduction to User Interfaces_ class required for the software engineering program at Iowa State University.

The project included the following tools
-react
-node.js
-express
-mongodb
-tailwindcss

##### ðŸ’¡ Idea:
The project was intended to be a music sharing website where users could visit artists' pages, like and review their music, read reviews from other users, and also purchase artists' merchandise.

##### ðŸ¤” Result
The project was a website that users could search for music artists that came from an API database. Users could like songs and view their liked songs in the profile page.
There was no review feature and users could not read other reviews, especially since this project never went live. 
There was also a mock store that stored users' orders.
**We did get full credit for this project ðŸ˜ƒ**.

> Unfortunately I have lost the demo video for this project.
> Also, I have since wiped my laptop and my subscription on one of the APIs have expired.
> This means this README ends here.
